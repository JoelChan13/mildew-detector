### Deployed version at [cherry-powdery-mildew-detector.herokuapp.com](https://cherry-powdery-mildew-detector.herokuapp.com/)

## Dataset Content

The dataset contains 4208 featured photos of single cherry leaves against a neutral background. The images of the cherry tree leaves were obtained from Farmy & Foods' crop fields and feature images of leaves that are either healthy or infested by powdery mildew. Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants and typically appears as white or grayish powdery spots on the leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits of the infected plants, mainly caused by various species of fungi and typically targets particular types of plants. Notwithstanding the fact that this disease affects many plant species, the client is particularly concerned about their cherry plantation crop, which is one of their finest products in the portfolio.

## Business Requirements

The primary objective of this project is to develop a Machine Learning system that aids Farmy & Foods in addressing the issue of powdery mildew affecting their cherry plantations. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. Due to this fact, manually inspecting all plants is not scalable, the client has outlined the following specific business requirements:

1. Visual Differentiation: Conduct a comprehensive study to visually differentiate between healthy cherry leaves and those infected with powdery mildew.
2. Predictive Modeling: Implement a predictive model capable of identifying whether a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew based on image analysis, with an accuracy target of 97%.
3. Interactive Dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard that allows users to upload cherry leaf images, receive predictions, and review the analysis results.

By meeting these requirements, the project will enable Farmy & Foods to maintain product quality and meet market demands effectively through large-scale automated detection.

## Hypothesis and Validation

1. **Hypothesis 1**: Visual Differentiation of Cherry Leaves - There are distinct visual differences between healthy cherry leaves and those affected by powdery mildew that can be identified through image analysis.
   - __How to validate__: This hypothesis can be tested by conducting a study that involves analyzing average images, variability images, and creating image montages for both healthy and powdery mildew-affected leaves. If the differences are visually apparent and consistent, this would support the hypothesis. The analysis will include identifying specific visual markers or patterns that distinguish healthy leaves from those affected by powdery mildew.<br/>

2. **Hypothesis 2**: Comparison of Mathematical Functions - The `softmax` function performs better than the `sigmoid` function as an activation function for the CNN output layer.
   - __How to validate__:  <br/>

3. **Hypothesis 3**: Use of ```RGB``` images for classification - Cherry leaf images converted from ```grayscale``` to ```RGB``` allow for an improved image classification performance.
   - __How to validate__: 


## Rationale for the Model

## Trial and Error

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks

The business requirements of the project have been mapped to specific data visualization and machine learning (ML) tasks to ensure that the project's objectives are met effectively. Below is a detailed rationale for each business requirement and how it corresponds to the relevant tasks:

### Business Requirement 1: Conduct a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one that contains powdery mildew.
> Rationale: The client is interested in understanding the visual differences between healthy and infected cherry leaves. This requirement can be addressed through detailed data analysis and visualization techniques that highlight the key features of each class.

#### Data Visualization Tasks:

1) Average Image and Variability Study:

- Purpose: Generate average images for both healthy and powdery mildew leaves, and study their variability.

- Visualization: Display the average images and variability heatmaps for each class to highlight common patterns and differences.

2) Difference Between Average Images:

- Purpose: Identify specific differences between healthy and mildew-affected leaves by subtracting the average healthy leaf image from the average mildew leaf image.

- Visualization: Use a difference image to visualize areas of the leaf where the most significant differences occur.

3) Image Montage:

- Purpose: Create a montage of sample images from both classes.

- Visualization: Display a grid of images showing healthy leaves and mildew-affected leaves side by side for easy comparison.

#### ML Tasks:

No direct ML task for this requirement as it focuses on visual analysis rather than predictive modeling.

### Business Requirement 2: Predict if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.
> Rationale: The client needs an automated system to predict whether a cherry leaf is healthy or infected with powdery mildew. This requirement is fulfilled by developing an ML model that classifies leaf images into these two categories.

#### Data Visualization Tasks:

1) Model Performance Visualization:

- Purpose: Visualize the model's learning curve (accuracy and loss over epochs) and the confusion matrix.

- Visualization: Plot the learning curves for training and validation sets, and display the confusion matrix to understand the model's performance and areas for improvement.

#### ML Tasks:

1) Data Preparation:

- Purpose: Prepare the dataset by preprocessing images, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

- ML Component: Ensures that the data is in a suitable format for training the model, increasing the robustness and accuracy of the predictions.

2) Model Architecture Design and Training:

- Purpose: Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the images.

- ML Component: The CNN model is specifically designed with an input layer, convolutional layers, fully connected layers, and an output layer to effectively capture the patterns associated with healthy and mildew-affected leaves.

3) Hyperparameter Tuning:

- Purpose: Optimize the model's performance by adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of filters, kernel size, and dropout rates.

- ML Component: Ensures that the model meets the desired accuracy and generalizes well to new data.

4) Model Evaluation:

- Purpose: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- ML Component: Validate the model's effectiveness in predicting healthy and mildew-affected leaves, ensuring it meets the performance criteria set by the client.

### Business Requirement 3: Deliver a Dashboard to present the findings and enable predictions.
> Rationale: The client requires a user-friendly dashboard to visualize the study results and interact with the prediction model.

#### Dashboard Tasks:

1) Summary Page:

- Purpose: Provide an overview of the dataset, the business requirements, and the project's goals.

- Dashboard Component: Text descriptions, dataset summary tables, and project objective outlines.


2) Visual Differentiation Page:

- Purpose: Display the results of the study that differentiates between healthy and infected leaves.

- Dashboard Component: Includes average images, difference images, variability heatmaps, and image montages.


3) Prediction Interface:

- Purpose: Allow users to upload images and get predictions on whether a leaf is healthy or infected. 

- Dashboard Component: File uploader widget, image display, prediction output, and downloadable results table.


4) Hypothesis Validation Page:

- Purpose: Outline the hypotheses tested and how they were validated.

- Dashboard Component: Textual explanations and visual evidence supporting the hypothesis conclusions.


5) Technical Model Performance Page:

- Purpose: Provide detailed insights into the modelâ€™s performance, including training/validation accuracy and loss, confusion matrix, and classification report.

- Dashboard Component: Interactive plots and detailed performance metrics.

## Bugs

- You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were unfixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable for consideration, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
